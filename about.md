Some information about myself other than programming skills!

Hi, I'm Sietse, a 22 year old Software Engineer currently living in Amsterdam.
I started out this blog as a fun way of sharing my projects and own experiences with programming and to give people and employers a better and broader view of who I am as a person.
I've started out my career as a Delivery cyclist, which was a very good way to make some money and to stay fit while learning how to code.
It was definitely fun to get to know the city of Amsterdam so well, especially cycling around the city late in the evening was nice.

Other than that, I like to play guitar a LOT. I recently have bought a studio-microphone to record some pieces on guitar, so perhaps I'll post some of them here soon!
I mostly play Jazz, blues and fingerstyle guitar. Music for me is a very exciting way to bring my mind into a sort of meditative state, just like with programming.
These activities capture my mind in a way that I can't really think about much else other than what I am currently doing.
